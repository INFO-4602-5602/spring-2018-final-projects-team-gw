      <h1 class="w3-center">How safe are vaccines in the United States?</h1><br>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Despite the controversy surrounding the safety of vaccines, most people trust that the CDC and drug manufacturers know what they are doing.  Is that a smart choice? The goal of this page is to present (the most objective) numbers (we currently have) regarding injuries or deaths that may be directly attributed to the administering of vaccines in the US.
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">The Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) was created to keep track of problematic side effects reported to healthcare providers. This system of record is kept and maintained by the Centers for Disease Control. Each year the VAERS database publishes its dataset documenting complications and deaths which could be the result of immunizations administered in the United States.</p>

      <!-- <h5 class="w3-center">Some vaccines may be directly responsible for deaths.</h5> -->
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Some vaccines may be directly responsible for deaths. In 2017, there were a total of 120 deaths recorded after a patient recieved a vaccination.  The vaccine with seemingly the highest risk was a combination vaccine, potentially causing 39 deaths. This vaccine consisted of two or more of the following: Diptheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Polio, Hib, Hepatitis.</p>

      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Many patients don't have reactions as severe as death. Other reactions, which may include migraines, allergies, infections, seizures, dizziness, shock, hepatic failure, acute kidney injury, and a wide variety of other ailments also get reported to VAERS. A total of 38,916 injuries were reported as potentially being a direct result of immunizations in 2017.</p>

      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium"><h1>Other things to know</h1><br>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">There are a couple of points to know about the VAERS numbers.  The CDC explicitly states that correlation is not causation.  It is unknown whether these reported events are caused by the vaccines, only that they occured AFTER the patient received the vaccine.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Additionally, it should be noted that VAERS is a passive reporting system.  This means they rely on patients and doctors to volunteer their accounts/experiences.  Because of this, the numbers are likely lower than actual, as not all events will be reported.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">For more details on VAERS and its effectiveness and limitations, please refer to:<br> Shimabukuro TT, Nguyen M, Martin D, DeStefano F. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4632204/">Safety monitoring in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).</a> Vaccine. 2015;33(36):4398-4405. doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.07.035.</p>
